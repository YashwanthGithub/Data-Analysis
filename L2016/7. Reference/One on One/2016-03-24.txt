1. Continue exploring canada data considering it as substantial task & also trying to collate as many attributes & metrics as possible. 
   Followed by it, we are trying to put it in place as in repository which can be used in near future.

2. We are unhappy about not receiving any anaytical/problem solving requests coming in from Allied. Discussed this in weekly catach up 
   with neha. Hopefully We expect requests to come.

3. Teradata exploration of tables is started, I have started recording every tables in regard of data dictionary, so that we can expect
  less effort in case of any requests on HOW to do it, WHY to do it.

4. I am really so graceful to have conservations with Neha & the team, especially after change in place. I also want you to keep track of
   how changes are being taking place within me expecially after the feedback. I agree took longer time than expected in understanding the
   organisational structure & workflow as I come from completely different system.

5. Lastly, I expect potential for my participation more in terms of actively involving in forums like Newsletter, any social welfare, 
   TGIF, Travel etc.
