# Notes

1. Rank the varibles as 1 for highly sold(Revenue) products. ~ 500

2. Since 75 products out of 500 products against ~ 2800 non-top-products are identified as top-products, build model by each Category.

3. Post calculating WOE & IV which explains that, IV > 0.1(Medium Predictive) when most of the review fall into the Bin 1 across all Quarters.
	a. Hence drill down(Conditionalise) data to where it has Reviews = 1 & re-rank the products.
	b. We have to identify products which has both "Revenue" & "Reviews" & then re-rank the products.
	Note : Hence it is not ideally correct to rank the products based on Revenue alone.
	c. There are no enough top-products(1) falling(proportion) into "Good"("Bad") when Reviews are high.
	
4. When WOE & IV are calculated by-category,
	a. Cleats & Trainind Aid : Reviews across all quarters shows "Unpredictive" but "Weak Predictive" particularly when Reviews = 1 & 3.
	b. Activity monitor : Reviews across all quarters shows "Ünpredictive" but "Weak Predictive" & "Medium predictive" particularly when Reviews = 1.
	c. Baseball Bat : Reviews are "Weak Predictive" under Q2 & Q3 particularly when Reviews = 1 & 2.
	d. Golf Complete Sets : Reviews across all quarters are "Medium Predictive" & "Weak predictive" particularly when Reviews = 0.
	e. NFL Apparel : Reviews across Q2,Q3,Q4 are "Medium Predictive" & "Weak predictive" particularly when Reviews = 1.
	f. Treadmill : Reviews are "Weak Predictive" particularly when Reviews = 0.
	g. Women's Running Shoes : Reviews are "Medium Predictive" & "Week predctive" particularly when Reviews = 0 & 1. 
	
	
5. Dimensionality of the data is way to less for Analysis.
	For example here is how the drill down goes for Activity Monitors,
		1.	Total number of records available from the Review crawled data = 229564-records..
		2.	Filtering data into time period consideration(2014-04-01 to 2015-03-31) dimension reduces to = 135408-records..
		3.	Further drilled to mapped products, data got reduced = 88.(reason being, most of the listed products either doesn’t have reviews(reviews = 0) or has duplicates(reviews > 1).
		4.	Lastly when we aggregate it on Quarterly level, it finally turned down = 23-records.
